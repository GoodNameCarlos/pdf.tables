# pdf.tables

## Overview

This package was developed for quick and easy extraction of effect size tables (OR, RR, HR) from research articles. It uses the ``pdftools`` package for the extraction of metadata from documents with a .pdf extension. The ``tidyverse`` and ``stringr`` packages are used for the retrieval, manipulation and organisation of information.

Pdf.table provides four functions to organize, extract, transform and ID the data:

+ ``str_split_pdf`` selects where the table is located in the metadata and organises the data.
+ ``pdf_tables`` extracts and sorts the data into a tibble. .
+ ``tables_extract`` extracts the effect size and the confidence intervals.
+ ``tables_ID`` adds ID, year, and other information to the data.
